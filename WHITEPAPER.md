## 3. Platform Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

ICPWork is built on a modular canister-based architecture that separates concerns into four primary smart contract canisters:

1. **User Management Canister**: Handles user identity, profiles, skills, verification, and reputation
2. **Project Management Canister**: Manages project listings, proposals, milestones, and deliverables
3. **Messaging System Canister**: Enables secure, encrypted communication between parties
4. **Payment Escrow Canister**: Secures funds and handles controlled release based on project completion

*Figure 1: ICPWork Platform Architecture*

### 3.2 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters
  - Motoko language for user, project, and messaging canisters
  - Rust for the payment escrow canister (enhanced security)
- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite, deployed on Vercel
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity integration
- **API Layer**: @dfinity/agent for canister communication

### 3.3 Data Flow and Communication

The system implements a secure cross-canister communication protocol that enables seamless interactions while maintaining data integrity and user privacy. All critical operations generate immutable audit trails on the blockchain.
